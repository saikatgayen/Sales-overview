The report is basically based on the dataset given below:

Here I have transformed the RAW dataset to tables and all the graphes are already in the .xlsx file but even afer that I have transformed the organized data into great reports using Power BI tool.

*For now that's all, Soon I will try to import my SQL querirs that helped me with the .xlsx files*
