On page 2, we can see many other office countries, and all the countries can be analysed by clicking on them, and we can also analyse the product line and the number of products bought by the customers.
By downloading the .pbix file, you can see the actions and can even try to analyse the countries and the products sold to the customers by yourself.

The report is based on the dataset given below:

Here are all the Screenshots of this .xlsx file, and additional graphs and data organised by type, and all the queries to organise the .xlsx file and pivot table.

Here, I have transformed the RAW dataset into normalized tables, and all the graphs are already in the .xlsx file. However, even after that, I have transformed the organized data into great reports using the Power BI tool.
